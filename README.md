# QLS_project
This repo contains the Fortran code used for simulations and the python notebook for grahpical visualization for the final project of the course "Quantitative Life Science", given by prof. Samir Suweis at the University of Padua in the academic year 2020/2021.\\
The poject aims to reproduce the numerical results of the paper "Constrained proteome allocation affects coexistence in models of competitive microbial communities" in repo.\\
This is a genralization of the previous work of the same authors, in which coexistence among many species, in an environment of limited resources, is rooted on reasonable biological assumptions, such as the proteome allocations for metabolism and growth.
