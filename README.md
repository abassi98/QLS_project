# QLS_project
This repo contains the Fortran code used for simulations and the python notebook for grahpical visualization for the final project of the course "Quantitative Life Science", given by prof. Samir Suweis at the University of Padua in the academic year 2020/2021.\\\
The project aims to reproduce numerical results from "Constrained proteome allocation affects coexistence in models of competitive microbial communities" in repo.\\\
This is a generalization of the same authors' previous work, in which coexistence among many species in an environment of limited resources is rooted on reasonable biological assumptions, such as the total proteome allocation for metabolism and growth.
